# Break Time

Break Time is a simple Python script that sends Mac desktop notifications on specified time intervals to encourage regular breaks from work.

## Purpose

Taking regular scheduled breaks from work has been shown to increase productivity, boost concentration, and lower stress. I wrote this script because I found myself regularly spending hours staring at a computer screen without breaks. Break Time sends visual and audible notifications to a Mac's desktop to encourage the user to practice healthy work habits!

## Compatibility

* Mac OS X 10.8+

## Installation

In `~./break-time/modules`, run the following command: 

```
chmod +x break-time
./break-time a b  # a is the desired work time in minutes; b is the desired break time in minutes
```

Good luck!
